# News Classifier 
## Final Project for Natural Language Processing Fall 2015

## Description

This programs take many news articles from around the web and use Naive Bayes and Linear Regression algorithms from the SciKit-Learn Python library to assign topic labels to them. The baseline system chooses between "Politics" and "Not Politics", while the second system also labels "Arts/Entertainment" and "Sports". The program then grades the accuracy for each label.
